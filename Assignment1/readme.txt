Hello, I am Parth Vaidya, and this is my directory for Assignment 1 of MCDA 5510 course.

This is the readme file for DirectoryWalker Assignment1 of MCDA 5510.
The path variable in the Main function and logs pathy in the class DirectoryWalker needs to be changed as per the execution environment.
The assumption for a skipped row is that if any value of the attribute (at least one) is an Empty string, then the row is counted as skipped row.
The program creates only some directories and files if they do not exist at the given path, rest needs to be present.
logging is also implemented and logs contain skipped rows from processing of the file,
The logs also contains the total execution time of the program.

The checked Exception handling part is left and I am working on it right now. once implemented, this readme file will be committed with a new commit.

Thank you,
Parth Vaidya(A00456020).
